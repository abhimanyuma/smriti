I am solving
["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis)
to learn some C++ for great fun and profit

# Instructions

1. Ensure you have `cmake` installed locally and that `which vcpkg` responds
   correctly.
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your Redis server, which is implemented in
   `src/Server.cpp`.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
